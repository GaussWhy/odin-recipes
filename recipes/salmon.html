<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>A quick roast at high heat is one of the breeziest ways to cook salmon. Stir together a tangy stone-ground mustard glaze and brush it over the fillets: You'll be done with prep before the oven finishes preheating.</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 ½ tablespoons stone-ground mustard</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon maple syrup</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon minced garlic</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon minced fresh thyme</li>
    <li>6 (6 ounce) frozen salmon fillets, thawed and patted dry</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with foil.</li>
    <li>Whisk together mustard, maple syrup, lemon juice, garlic, and thyme in a small bowl.</li>
    <li>Season salmon on both sides with salt and pepper and brush with oil. Arrange salmon on prepared baking sheet. Brush with mustard mixture.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until salmon flakes easily with a fork, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Chef's Notes:</h3>
<p>If your salmon has skin, arrange skin sides down on the baking sheet.</p>
